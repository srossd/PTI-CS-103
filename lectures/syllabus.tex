\section{Overview of course}

Knowing just a little bit of computer science can get you started right away in
writing code for real-world applications. In this course, you will learn about
the fascinating subject of computer science. You will develop algorithmic
thinking skills that will improve day-to-day critical thinking and
problem-solving. Perhaps most importantly, you will learn to code, which will
not only open up new job opportunities but also make you more effective in most
areas of business.

In the first semester, we'll learn a lot of computer science theory and a little bit of coding. In the second semester, we will focus almost exclusively on coding. 

Broadly, we will cover the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How modern computers work
    	\begin{itemize}
       		\item Hardware
       		\item Software
       		\item Computer networks and information systems
    	\end{itemize}
    \item Algorithms for quickly solving complex problems
    	\begin{itemize}
       		\item Searching
       		\item Sorting
    	\end{itemize}
    \item Data structures 
    	\begin{itemize}
       		\item Arrays
       		\item ArrayLists
    	\end{itemize}
    \item Applications of Computer science
    	\begin{itemize}
       		\item Basic coding in Java
       		\item How to use productivity software
    	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
